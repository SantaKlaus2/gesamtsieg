 ger_footsteps:0 "In The Footsteps Of Great Men"
 ger_footsteps_desc:0 "Friedrich Barbarossa, Friedrich II von Hohenzollern, Otto von Bismarck and finally, Adolf Hitler. What do all these men have in common? It is simple, all of them are great men that brought great changes to Germany, allowed for her to be transformed and to evolve, to better be able to endure the tempestuous winds of history that tore some many others apart and brought them down till they became nothing but footnotes. It is in thanks to all of them and most of all our Führer that we may stand here today at our rightful place: As the Aryan conquerors of the world! \n\nThough the Führer stands out from his predecessors in one important aspect: His heart still beats within his body. With a clenched fist ready to strike down all possible enemies of the Fatherland and a steady, vigilant gaze that sees the dangers lurking beneath the surface he stands watch, unflinching like a marble statue." 
 ger_volkshalle:0 "Grand Opening Of The Volkshalle"
 ger_volkshalle_desc:0"Nothing in the realm of Aryan culture represents our greatest triumph against the Jewry and the Asiatic hordes as this colossal structure. Towering above the Reich it is a monument to our ingenuity and to our will that can triumph over all. \n\nIt took us over 10 years, it took reinforcing millions of tonnes of soil, it took the engineering genius of the Reichsarchitekt Albert Speer, it took the sweaty brows thousands of Germans and the pilled corpses of dozens of thousands of subhumans but in the end it was achieved. \n\nAs the opening ceremony approaches, countless preparations are being made, crowds of millions will be present in Germania and among them 180 000 fortunate citizens will receive the privilege of being present for the Führers first speech given under this coffered dome."
 ger_thousand_year_reich:0"Tausendjähriges Reich"
 ger_thousand_year_reich_desc:0 "It has been 10 years (subject to change) since our final victory in the Second World War. Millions of brave Aryans had to give their labour, their health and their very lives for the sake of our dream of a pure Europe. Now this dream has become a reality. The cleansing fire had spread to all corners of the old continent, ridding it free from the maladies that plagued it for so long. \n\nAs the wounds we suffered heal and as the families of the deceased come to terms we could turn a new page. A new Germany will march into the future; a thousand year unyielding march of progress and of civilization. Let the subhuman hordes scream and wail as they like, as tomorrow a new sun shall rise and it shall rise in the west!"
