 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "§YAdolf Hitler§!, a name truly known throughout the whole world, be it associated with curses or praises. Born to a family of a customs officer in a border part of Austria-Hungary, he wandered in life in his early years. From attending technical school to attempting and failing twice to join the Academy of the fine Arts of Vienna and even spending several years living in various homeless shelters, he was deemed unfit to serve in the Austrian army due to his poor health. \n\nAt the outbreak of the war he volunteered rather to join the Bavarian army of the German Empire and was accepted. Having fought for four years he was wounded twice, temporarily went blind and received the Iron Cross first class, a rate medal for one of such low rank. Shocked by the capitulation of the Reich he deemed it a stab in the back by the traitorous elements of German society, chief of all the Jews and the Marxists.\n\nEntering the world of politics and after a long struggle for control he lead his National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) to victory and secured power by proclaiming himself the Reichsführer and Kanzler, the head of government and head of state simultaneously.\n\nHaving dealt with his internal enemies he marched Germany’s armies to war, once more engulfing the world in flames. Dozens of millions died and out of that hellish inferno of bravery, fanaticism and madness Germania came out as the greatest victor, peering down upon her fallen foes.\n\nNow he, once jobless then a common soldier has become the closest thing to a cosmocrat in human history. Presiding over a colossal empire with the strongest military at his beck and call, nothing can oppose him, nothing except the natural entropy. Entropy which binds all things in the universe and that cannot be escaped from by man."
