USA_memories_of_operation_downfall_desc:0 "The only way to make Japan surrender to America was to launch Operation Downfall, an operation to naval invade Japan. We managed to beat Japan, but that came at the cost of tens of thousands of American lives. Because of this operation's partial failure, many citizens are now reluctant to join the army and get into another war."
